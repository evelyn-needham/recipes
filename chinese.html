<h2> Chinese Food </h2>
  <h4> Pot Sticker Soup </h4>
  <p> Ingredients: <br>
1/2 pound Chinese or napa cabbage, thinly sliced <br>
2 celery ribs, thinly sliced <br>
2 medium carrots, cut into matchsticks <br>
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions <br>
2 to 3 tablespoons soy sauce <br>
2 tablespoons rice vinegar <br>
3 garlic cloves, minced <br>
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger <br>
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil <br>
6 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth <br>
1 package (16 ounces) frozen chicken potstickers <br>
Crispy chow mein noodles, optional <br>
<br>
In a 4-qt. slow cooker, combine the first nine ingredients. Stir in broth. Cook, covered, on low until vegetables are tender, 5-6 hours. Add potstickers; cook, covered, on high until heated through, 15-20 minutes. If desired, sprinkle with chow mein noodles before servings.
</p>
<h4> Asain Wraps </h4>
<p> Ingredients: <br>
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast halves <br>
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce <br>
1/4 cup ketchup <br>
1/4 cup honey <br>
2 tablespoons minced fresh gingerroot <br>
2 tablespoons sesame oil <br>
1 small onion, finely chopped <br>
2 tablespoons cornstarch <br>
2 tablespoons cold water <br>
12 round rice papers (8 inches) <br>
3 cups broccoli coleslaw mix <br>
3/4 cup crispy chow mein noodles <br>
<br>
Place chicken in a 3-qt. slow cooker. In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, ketchup, honey, ginger and oil; stir in onion. Pour over chicken. Cook, covered, on low until chicken is tender, 3-4 hours. Remove chicken; shred with two forks and refrigerate until assembly.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix cornstarch and water until smooth; gradually stir into honey mixture. Cook, covered, on high until sauce is thickened, 20-30 minutes. Toss chicken with 3/4 cup sauce; reserve remaining sauce for serving.
Fill a large shallow dish partway with water. Dip a rice paper wrapper into water just until pliable, about 45 seconds (do not soften completely); allow excess water to drip off.
Place wrapper on a flat surface. Layer 1/4 cup coleslaw, 1/3 cup chicken mixture and 1 tablespoon noodles across bottom third of wrapper. Fold in both sides of wrapper; fold bottom over filling, then roll up tightly. Place on a serving plate, seam side down. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve with reserved sauce.

<h4>  Sesame Chicken Noodles </h4>
<p>Makes 4 servings <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 tablespoon sesame oil <br>
1 package (22 ounces) frozen grilled chicken breast strips <br>
1 medium yellow summer squash, thinly sliced <br>
1 cup julienned carrots <br>
1/3 cup halved fresh snow peas <br>
3 garlic cloves, minced <br>
2 packages (3 ounces each) chicken ramen noodles, broken into small pieces <br>
1-1/3 cups water <br>
1/3 cup white wine or chicken broth <br>
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce <br>
4 green onions, sliced <br>
<br>
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat; saute chicken, squash and carrots until chicken is heated through, 6-8 minutes. Add snow peas; cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, 3-4 minutes. Add garlic and contents of one ramen seasoning packet (discard or save second packet for another use); cook and stir 1 minute.
Add noodles, water, wine and teriyaki sauce. Bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, until noodles are tender, 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove from heat; stir in green onions. Serve immediately.

<h4> Crispy Baked Wontons </h4>
<p>Makes about 4 dozen <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1/2 pound ground pork <br>
1/2 pound extra-lean ground turkey <br>
1 small onion, chopped <br>
1 can (8 ounces) sliced water chestnuts, drained and chopped <br>
1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce <br>
1/4 cup egg substitute <br>
1-1/2 teaspoons ground ginger <br>
1 package (12 ounces) wonton wrappers <br>
Cooking spray <br>
Sweet-and-sour sauce, optional <br>
<br>
In a large skillet, cook the pork, turkey and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the water chestnuts, soy sauce, egg substitute and ginger.
Position a wonton wrapper with one point toward you. (Keep remaining wrappers covered with a damp paper towel until ready to use.) Place 2 heaping teaspoons of filling in the center of wrapper. Fold bottom corner over filling; fold sides toward center over filling. Roll toward the remaining point. Moisten top corner with water; press to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
Place on baking sheets coated with cooking spray; lightly coat wontons with additional cooking spray.
Bake at 400° for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Serve warm, with sweet-and-sour sauce if desired.
Freeze option: Freeze cooled baked wontons in a freezer container, separating layers with waxed paper. To use, reheat on a baking sheet in a preheated 400° oven until crisp and heated through.
Test Kitchen TipsOne beaten egg will work in place of the egg substitute.
Mix it up! Wontons can be folded into a variety of shapes. For a simple triangle, place filling in center of a wonton wrapper; moisten edges with water. Fold one corner diagonally over filling to form a triangle; press edges to seal.
Try using grated fresh ginger instead of dried. Fresh ginger is potent, though: 3/4 teaspoon should do the trick.

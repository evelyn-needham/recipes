<h2> Indian Food </h2>
  <h4> Naan </h4>
    <p> INGREDIENTS: <br>
4 lemongrass stalks, trimmed, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced<br>
4 cloves garlic chopped<br>
4 kaffir lime leaves, chopped<br>
2 tablespoons chopped peeled ginger<br>
2 red Thai chiles, with seeds, sliced<br>
3 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2” pieces<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
2 whole star anise pods<br>
1 cinnamon stick<br>
½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce<br>
1 tablespoon fish sauce (such as nam pla or nuoc nam)<br>
¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar<br>
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes<br>
4 medium shallots, quartered<br>
1 pound carrots, peeled, cut into 2” lengths, halved if large<br>
4 scallions, cut into 1” lengths, plus more for serving<br>
8 oz. wide rice noodles<br>
<br>
Process lemongrass, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, and 2 chiles in a food processor until a fine paste forms.
Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook beef, turning occasionally, until browned, 10–15 minutes; transfer to a plate.
Cook lemongrass paste in same pot, stirring often, until lemongrass is beginning to soften, 5–8 minutes. Add star anise, cinnamon, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, beef with any juices, and 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, skimming occasionally, until beef is tender and liquid is slightly thickened, 2½–3 hours.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°. Toast coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden around the edges, about 4 minutes; set aside.
Add shallots and carrots to stew and cook, partially covered, until vegetables are soft and beef is falling apart, 35–45 minutes. Mix in scallions (they should wilt slightly).
Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions.
Divide noodles among bowls and ladle stew over; top with toasted coconut and more scallions. Serve with lime wedges.
DO AHEAD: Stew (without noodles) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.

<h4> Saag Paneeer </h4>
  <p>
    Yield: serves 4<br>
    INGREDIENTS: <br>
8 cups milk<br>
1⁄4 cup fresh lemon juice<br>
6 tbsp. ghee or canola oil<br>
For the Spinach<br>
4 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
1 serrano chile, stemmed and chopped<br>
6 cups finely chopped spinach<br>
Kosher salt, to taste<br>
6 tbsp. heavy cream<br>
1⁄2 tsp. garam masala<br>
1⁄4 tsp. cayenne<br>
1 (1") piece of ginger, peeled and chopped<br>
Indian flatbread or rice, for serving<br>
<br>
Make the cheese: Line a colander with 4 layers of cheesecloth, draping it over sides, and set in a sink. Bring milk to just under a boil in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring often with a wooden spoon to prevent it from scorching. Reduce heat to medium-low, add juice, and gently stir until large curds form, about 30 seconds. Pour milk mixture into colander and gently rinse off under cold running water any foam and residual lemon juice from curds. Gather corners of cheesecloth together and gently squeeze out liquid. Tie opposite corners of cheesecloth together to make a sack, and hang it from a large kitchen spoon suspended over a deep bowl. Set aside at room temperature until excess liquid has thoroughly drained from cheese, about 1 1⁄2 hours. Transfer sack to a plate, untie cheesecloth, and loosely drape corners over cheese. Place a large heavy pot on top of cheese, then set aside for 30 minutes to compress cheese. Remove pot and unwrap cheese. Cut into 1⁄2″ x 1″ pieces. Heat ghee in a 12″ nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add cheese, and fry until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer cheese to a plate and set aside; reserve skillet with ghee.
Make the spinach: Place garlic, ginger, chiles, and 1⁄4 cup water into blender and purée into a smooth paste. Return skillet with ghee to stove, and heat over medium-high heat. Add ginger-garlic paste, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach, salt to taste, and cook, stirring often, until spinach wilts, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring often, until spinach is very soft, about 15 minutes. Stir in cream, garam masala, and cayenne.
Add cheese to skillet, cover, and continue cooking until liquid thickens and spinach is soft, about 15 minutes. Serve with flatbread or rice, if you like.

Stir in the cumin, ground fennel, and cardamom and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and coconut cream and bring to a simmer; let cook, uncovered, 5 minutes.

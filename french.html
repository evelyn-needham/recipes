<h2> French Foods </h2>
<p> <h4>French Onion Soup </h4>
 Servings 4 <br>
Ingredients<br>
2 extra large onions (8 cups sliced onions), sliced thinly into crescent shapes<br>
1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter (21 grams)<br>
1 tbsp oil (14 grams)<br>
1/2 tsp salt (2.8 grams)<br>
1/8 tsp sugar (less than 1 gram)<br>
1 1/2 tbsp all-purpose flour (~10 grams)<br>
4 cups low-sodium beef broth (907 grams)<br>
ground pepper and salt to taste <br>
crusty French bread sliced<br>
4 oz gruyere cheese for the top or gruyere-cheddar mix<br>
<br>
Melt butter with oil over low heat in a dutch oven or large pot. Add the onion slices into the pot and cover for 15 minutes.
Slice your bread into 1/2 inch slices and toast them. Temporarily set aside.
Raise the stove heat slightly and stir in 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp of sugar. Cook, uncovered, for another 40 to 45 minutes until onions have caramelized, stirring occasionally throughout the duration. Note: Do not rush this step as it is essential for developing the onion flavor.
Sprinkle (1 1/2 tbsp) flour into the pot, stir, and cook for another 3 minutes. Slowly stream the broth into the pot, stirring as your pour. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, to your taste. Just don't make the soup too salty if you're using a salty cheese like gruyere. Cook for another 20 minutes until simmering and hot. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
Once the soup is ready, divide the soup among 4 oven-safe bowls. Place 4 or 5 baguette slices into each bowl. Then top each bowl with grated cheese (about 1/4 cup of grated cheese per bowl). Bake until cheese completely melts.

<p> <h4>French Country Salad with Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette </h4>
 Servings 4 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 (5 oz.) bag of arugula<br>
1/2 pound asparagus tough ends trimmed<br>
olive oil to drizzle over asparagus<br>
sea salt to sprinkle over asparagus<br>
1/2 cup sliced cooked beets canned, jarred, home-cooked<br>
1/2 cup whole walnuts or pecans toasted<br>
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese<br>
For the vinaigrette<br>
2 tbsp dijon mustard<br>
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br>
2 tbsp olive oil<br>
2 cloves small garlic minced<br>
1/2 tsp sea salt<br>
pinch of freshly ground black pepper<br>
juice of 1/2 a lemon<br>
zest of 1/2 a lemon<br>
<br>
To create the salad
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Cut the asparagus into 1 1/2" long pieces. Spread the asparagus out onto the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the asparagus along with a sprinkle of sea salt. Roast for 4 to 5 minutes, until the asparagus is tender but still has a bite. Allow the asparagus to cool before using.
Toss the arugula with the asparagus in a large bowl; temporarily set aside.
To create the dressing
Whisk all of the vinaigrette ingredients together in a small measuring cup.
To assemble
Toss the salad with the vinaigrette until everything is lightly coated in the dressing. Then garnish the salad with the sliced beets, toasted nuts, and crumbled goat cheese. </p>
<p> <h4> Ratatouille</h4>
 4 servings <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 whole white onion <br>
1 large japanese eggplant <br>
1 large zucchini squash <br>
1 bell pepper<br>
2 medium tomatoes (tomatoes on the vine) <br>
2 large cloves garlic <br>
2 sprigs thyme <br>
olive oil <br>
salt and pepper <br>
<br>
In a large saucepan or pot, warm enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Warm over low heat. In the meanwhile, chop your onion into small chunks. Add the onion to the pot to cook until tender - about 5 minutes.
While the onion cooks, chop your other veggies. Remove both ends from both the eggplant and the squash; cut each into cubes. Cut a medium dice on the bell pepper and tomatoes. For the garlic, simply peel the skin, slightly smash with your knife and cut into a rough chop.
Once the onions are tender, add the garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add all the veggies to the pot. Add a generous pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper. Add the thyme. Cover the saucepan or pot with a lid and cook over medium-low heat for approximately 40 minutes, until all the veggies are tender and there is little liquid in the pot.  </p>
<p> <h4>French Omelette </h4>
 Servings 1 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 egg <br>
1 tbsp milk <br>
1 tbsp chopped chives <br>
1 tbsp chopped basil <br>
1/2 tbsp chopped tarragon <br>
pinch of sea salt<br>
pinch of ground pepper <br>
olive oil for the pan <br>
1 tbsp goat cheese crumbled<br>
1 sundried tomato sliced thinly and oil drained <br>
<br>
To a small bowl, add the milk, egg, salt, and pepper. Give it a whisk just until you've got several small bubbles forming (avoid mixing too much and creating large bubbles). Add half of the fresh herbs and give it a gentle stir to combine.
Add 1 tbsp of olive oil to a small pan (5 inches would be preferable - see note at end). Warm the oil over medium heat, and give it a swirl around the pan so that it coats the entire bottom of the pan and a little bit along the sides of the pan.
Pour the egg mixture into the center of the pan. Now swirl the pan around so that the egg batter goes to the edges of the pan. Use a rubber spatula to gently push extra egg batter to the edges of the pan, taking care not to scrape the pan but rather gently nudge the batter to spread out.
Once the egg batter looks like it's set on the bottom and is starting to bubble up a bit, lift the pan up and tilt it to one side to slide the egg onto an awaiting (large) spatula. Use the spatula to flip the egg onto its other side into the pan. Move the pan back over to the heat onto low heat.
Add the crumbled goat cheese and sun-dried tomato slices onto the center of the omelette, like you would for a burrito. Use your rubber spatula to gently fold one side of the omelette over, then fold the omelette one more time over itself. You're essentially folding the omelette into thirds, like a letter. Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining fresh herbs.

<p> <h4>French Crepe </h4>
 Servings 8 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 eggs <br>
1/4 cup butter melted <br>
2 1/2 tbsp sugar <br>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour <br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
1/8 cup water<br>
1/2 tsp vanilla<br>
tiny dash of salt <br>
1 cup heavy whipping cream <br>
2-4 tbsp powdered sugar (to taste) <br>
1/2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
fresh strawberry slices<br>
<br>
Whisk all the ingredients, except the flour, together. Add in the flour, a little bit at a time, whisking just until the flour has been mixed in.
Let the crepe batter rest for 10 minutes. Then, give the batter a quick whisk again before using.
Grease a non-stick, 6" skillet with unsalted butter and heat over medium heat. Pour about 2-3 tablespoons worth of batter into the pan and tip the pan from side to side to get the batter to spread out throughout the pan.
Cook each side of the crepe for 30 seconds before gently loosening up the edges with a large spatula. If it lifts, then the crepe is ready to be flipped. If it doesn't lift up very well, give it 10 to 15 more seconds and try again. Gently lift the crepe out of the pan, then flip over into the pan and cook the other side for another 10 to 15 seconds; remove to cool.
Simply beat the heavy whipping cream with a hand mixer or stand mixer until soft peaks form. Add in the powdered sugar and vanilla, then beat until stiff peaks form.
Spread a layer of cream onto each crepe, add sliced strawberries, and then roll the crepe like you would a wrap. </p>

<h2> Mexican Foods </h2>
 <p> <h4>Tacos Carne Asada </h4>
Yield: 4 servings (2 tacos per person) <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 pounds flank or skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat<br>
1 recipe Mojo, recipe follows<br>
Olive oil, for coating the grill<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
16 (7-inch) corn tortillas<br>
Shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce, for serving<br>
Chopped white onion, for serving<br>
Shredded Jack cheese, for serving<br>
1/2 cup Pico de Gallo, recipe follows<br>
2 limes, cut in wedges for serving<br>
4 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 jalapeno, minced<br>
1 large handful fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 limes, juiced<br>
1 orange, juiced <br>
2 tablespoons white vinegar<br>
1/2 cup olive oil<br>
4 vine-ripe tomatoes, chopped<br>
1/2 medium red onion, chopped <br>
2 green onions, white and green parts, sliced<br>
1 Serrano chile, minced<br>
1 handful fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br>
3 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 lime, juiced<br>
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
Lay the flank steak in a large baking dish and pour the mojo over it. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 8 hours, so the flavors can sink into the meat. Don't marinate the steak for more than 8 hours though, or the fibers break down too much and the meat gets mushy.
Preheat an outdoor grill or a ridged grill pan over medium-high flame (you can also use a broiler). Brush the grates with a little oil to prevent the meat from sticking. Pull the steak out of the mojo marinade and season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill (or broil) the steak for 7 to 10 minutes per side, turning once, until medium-rare. Remove the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes to allow the juices to settle. Thinly slice the steak across the grain on a diagonal.
Warm the tortillas for 30 seconds on each side in a dry skillet or on the grill, until toasty and pliable.
To make the tacos, stack up 2 of the warm tortillas, lay about 4 ounces of beef down the center, and sprinkle with some lettuce, onion, and cheese. Top each taco with a spoonful of the Pico de Gallo salsa and garnish with lime wedges. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.
In a mortar and pestle or bowl, mash together the garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, salt, and pepper to make a paste. Put the paste in a glass jar or plastic container. Add the lime juice, orange juice, vinegar, and oil. Shake it up really well to combine. Use as a marinade for chicken or beef or as a table condiment.

<p> <h4>Garlicky Holy Guacamole with Chips </h4>
Yield: 4 servings <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 ripe small Hass avocados<br>
1 lemon, juiced<br>
1 large clove garlic, minced<br>
1 jalapeno, seeded and finely chopped<br>
1 small plum tomato, seeded and finely chopped<br>
1/2 small yellow skinned onion, finely chopped<br>
1 teaspoon coarse salt<br>
Blue corn tortilla chips, for dipping<br>
<br>
Cut avocados in half around the pit. Separate the halves. Pop out pit with spoon, then scoop flesh of avocados into a bowl. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over the avocados. Squeeze the juice with the lemon halves facing cut-side up, allowing the juice to spill down over the sides of the lemon into the bowl. This method keeps the seeds in the lemon and out of the guacamole. Add garlic, jalapeno, tomato, onion and salt to the bowl. Mash and mix the ingredients into a chunky dip using a fork. Serve with blue corn tortilla chips. </p>
<p> <h4>Salsa and Chips </h4>
Yield: about 2 cups<br>
Ingredients: <br>
4 ripe tomatoes or 4 plum tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped<br>
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped (about 3 tablespoons)<br>
1 jalapeno (or to taste), minced<br>
1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
Vegetable oil for frying<br>
Twelve 6-inch corn tortillas (preferably white)<br>
Fine salt<br>
<br>
In a small bowl, mix together the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, coriander. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour. Serve with Tortilla Chips.
Tortilla Chips
Pour the oil into a large heavy-bottomed pot to a depth of about 2 inches. Place a deep-frying thermometer in the pot. Heat the oil over medium heat to 360 degrees F.
Meanwhile, stack the tortillas, and cut the pile into sixths to make chips.
Raise the heat to high. Working in batches, fry the chips, turning them with a skimmer or slotted spoon, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chips to a paper towel-lined pan to drain. (Return the oil to the proper temperature between batches.) Cool and season with salt. Serve. </p>
<p> <h4>Spicy Black Beans and Yellow Rice </h4>
Yield: 8 servings <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 cups (about 1 pound) dried black beans, picked over, soaked overnight<br>
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
1/2 medium onion, diced<br>
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped<br>
2 cloves garlic, chopped <br>
1 bay leaf<br>
Kosher salt<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 cups long-grain rice<br>
4 cups water<br>
2 cloves garlic, smashed<br>
1 tablespoon turmeric<br>
1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
1 bay leaf<br>
<br>
In a large pot, soak beans overnight covered in water by 2 inches. Drain and set aside.
In the same pot, heat the olive oil. Add the onion, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and bay leaf and cook until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the beans and cover with water by about 1-inch. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are tender. Remove the bay leaf and discard. Taste the beans and season with salt and pepper.
For the rice:
Put all the ingredients into a heavy-bottomed pot, stir well, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook over low heat until the rice has absorbed the water, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Discard the garlic and bay leaf, fluff with a fork, and serve. </p>
<p>  <h4>Chicken and Beef Fajitas </h4>
Yield: 15 servings <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1/2 cup olive oil <br>
1/4 cup chili powder <br>
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce <br>
1 tablespoon ground cumin <br>
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes <br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
Juice of 3 limes<br>
1 tablespoon sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br>
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br>
3 pounds skirt steak<br>
5 plum (Roma) tomatoes <br>
3 jalapeno peppers<br>
1/2 large (or 1 small) onion<br>
1 bunch fresh cilantro<br>
1/2 lime<br>
Salt <br>
<br>
2 medium onions, halved and sliced <br>
1 green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips<br>
1 orange bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips<br>
1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips<br>
1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and sliced into strips<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
30 to 40 flour tortillas <br>
Fiesta Beans, recipe follows <br>
1 pound grated Cheddar cheese<br>
One 8-ounce container sour cream<br>
5 limes, sliced into wedges<br>
Fiesta Beans:<br>
2 pounds dried pinto beans<br>
6 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced<br>
2 orange bell peppers, seeded and diced<br>
2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced<br>
1 onion, diced<br>
1 ham hock (or 6 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into pieces)<br>
1 tablespoon chili powder<br>
1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon black pepper<br>
<br>
In a blender, combine the olive oil, chili powder, Worcestershire, cumin, red pepper flakes, garlic and lime juice. Next add the sugar, salt and pepper and blend the marinade until it's totally combined and smooth.
Place the chicken and beef in separate 2-quart baking dishes or large resealable plastic storage bags. Pour the marinade over the chicken and beef and rub the marinade all over the meat. Give your hands a good wash, and then cover the dishes with plastic wrap and let them marinate in the fridge for 4 to 6 hours.
Chop the tomatoes, jalapenos and onion into a very small dice. (Leave the seeds in your jalapenos for a hotter pico. Adjust the amount of jalapenos to your preferred temperature.) Next, chop up a nice-sized bunch of cilantro. Just remove and discard the long leafless stems before chopping. No need to remove the leaves from the stems completely. Place all of these ingredients together in a bowl and give it a good stir. Squeeze the juice of half a lime into the bowl. Add salt to taste and stir again.
Throw the onions and bell peppers into a bowl and toss with the olive oil and some salt and pepper.
When ready to cook, preheat the grill to high heat.
Cook the chicken on both sides until completely cooked through (or to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F), about 4 minutes per side. Remove it to a platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Grill the beef on both sides until completely cooked through, about 5 minutes in total. Remove it to a platter to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Tip the fajita vegetables into a grill basket and grill until cooked, tossing occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Pile the veggies on a platter. Slice the chicken and beef.
Wrap the tortillas in foil and warm through on the grill. Serve the chicken, beef and veggies with the warm tortillas, Fiesta Beans, grated cheese, sour cream, lime wedges and pico de gallo.
Place the beans in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Set them aside and let them soak for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
Drain and rinse the beans, and then place them in a large pot. Add the garlic, green, orange and red bell peppers and the onions. Cover them with about an inch of water, and then add the ham hock or bacon. Next add the chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Stir to combine, and then bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the beans until tender, about 2 hours. Check the liquid level about halfway through the cooking process; if you'd prefer the beans to be less soupy, you can ladle off about a third of the cooking liquid. </p>

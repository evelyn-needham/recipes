<h2> Italian Foods </h2>
<p> <h4>Easy Pasta e Fagioli Soup </h4>
YIELDS:
6 <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil<br>
1/2 lb. spicy (or sweet) Italian sausage <br>
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped<br>
2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped<br>
2 stalks celery, finely chopped<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
kosher salt<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 (15-oz.) cans Great Northern Beans<br>
1 (15-oz.) can diced tomatoes<br>
4 c. Swanson Chicken Broth<br>
2 sprigs rosemary, leaves finely chopped<br>
1 1/2 c. ditalini pasta (or other small shape)<br>
Freshly grated Parmesan, for garnish<br>
Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish<br>

<br>
In a large, deep pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, carrots, and celery and cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper, then add in beans (with their liquid), diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rosemary. Bring to a boil, then stir in ditalini.
Reduce heat to medium and cook until pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Serve in bowls garnished with Parmesan and parsley. </p>
<p> <h4>Calzones </h4>
YIELDS:4 <br>

INGREDIENTS: <br>
Cooking spray<br>
1 3/4 lb. pizza dough<br>
All-purpose flour, for surface<br>
1 c. pizza sauce<br>
1 c. ricotta<br>
1/2 c. pepperoni<br>
1 c. shredded mozzarella<br>
Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing<br>
Kosher salt<br>

<br>
Preheat oven to 500° and grease two large baking sheets with cooking spray. Divide pizza dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough out into an 8" circle, about ¼" thick. Spoon pizza sauce in middle of dough, then dot with ricotta and top with pepperoni and mozzarella.
Gently fold dough in half, dampen seams with water and pinch together, then crimp edges all around. Repeat with remaining dough. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Brush tops with oil and sprinkle with salt. Using kitchen scissors or a sharp knife, slit tops in 2 to 3 spots to create steam vents.
Bake until tops are golden and filling is bubbling, 20 minutes, brushing with more oil halfway through. Let cool 5 minutes before cutting open. </p>

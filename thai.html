<h2> Thai Food </h2>
  <h4> Red Curry Mussels </h4>
  <p> INGREDIENTS: <br>
1 13.5-oz. can coconut milk <br>
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes <br>
½ cup dry white wine <br>
1 tablespoon Thai red curry paste <br>
4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided <br>
½ medium red onion, thinly sliced <br>
1 carrot, peeled, julienned <br>
1 celery stalk, thinly sliced on a diagonal <br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>
2 pounds mussels, scrubbed, debearded <br>
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley <br>
Toasted country-style bread (for serving) <br>
<br>
Bring coconut milk, tomatoes, wine, curry paste, and 2 Tbsp. basil to a boil in a Dutch oven or other large pot, stirring to incorporate curry paste. Reduce heat and add onion, carrot, and celery; season with salt and pepper.
Bring liquid to a simmer, cover pot, and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a medium bowl and set aside.
Return liquid in pot to a simmer. Add mussels to pot, cover, and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until shells open (discard any mussels that do not open), about 4 minutes.
Divide mussels and cooking liquid among bowls, top with reserved vegetables, parsley, and remaining 2 Tbsp. basil, and serve with bread alongside. </p>
<h4> Thai Grilled Chicken Wings </h4>
<p> 4 servings <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
Dipping Sauce <br>
6 dried chiles de árbol <br>
⅓ cup fish sauce <br>
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice <br>
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds <br>
2 teaspoons sugar <br>
½ cup oyster sauce <br>
½ cup Thai thin soy sauce <br>
2 tablespoons sugar <br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper <br>
2 pounds chicken wings, tips removed, drumettes and flats separated <br>
A spice mill or a mortar and pestle; twelve 8" bamboo skewers soaked in water at least 1 hour <br>
<br>
Grind chiles in spice mill to a fine powder. Mix chile powder, fish sauce, lime juice, sesame seeds, and sugar in a medium bowl to dissolve sugar. Adjust with more sugar or lime juice if needed.
Wings and Assembly
Prepare grill for medium-high heat. Combine oyster and soy sauces, sugar, oil, and pepper in a large bowl. Add wings; toss to coat. Let sit 20–30 minutes (if allowed to marinate longer, they’ll be too salty). Thread 2 flat pieces onto each skewer on a diagonal, spacing about ½" apart. Grill along with drumettes, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through, 6–8 minutes. Serve with dipping sauce.

<h4> Long Bean, Cucumber, and Tomato Salad </h4>
4 servings <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
2 dried Thai chiles, soaked for 2 minutes in warm water, drained <br>
3 small garlic cloves, crushed <br>
1/4 lime, cut into 3 wedges <br>
1 tablespoon palm sugar or granulated sugar <br>
1 tablespoon dried tiny shrimp <br>
9 long beans (2 1/2 ounces) or green beans, trimmed, cut into 2 1/2' lengths <br>
2 kirby cucumbers or 1 English hothouse cucumber, coarsely chopped into 1' pieces <br>
2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce (nam pla) <br>
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice <br>
6 cherry tomatoes, halved <br>
2 tablespoons crushed roasted, unsalted peanuts <br>
<br>
Place first 4 ingredients in a clay mortar and pound with a wooden pestle until mashed into a fine paste, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp; mash until pulverized and well combined, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, process in a mini-processor until finely chopped.)
Add long beans to mortar; lightly crush with pestle to bruise. Add cucumber pieces, fish sauce, and lime juice. Mix well. Add tomatoes, lightly crush, and mix in. (Alternatively, place beans and tomatoes in a resealable plastic bag. Roll a rolling pin over bag to bruise vegetables; transfer to a bowl with the cucumber, fish sauce, lime juice, and chile dressing.) Let marinate for 10 minutes. Stir in peanuts.

<h4> Stir-Fried Brussels Sprouts with Garlic and Chile </h4>

4-6 servings <br>
INGREDIENTS:
4 cups halved brussels sprouts <br>
Kosher salt <br>
1/4 cup vegetable oil <br>
2 tablespoons thinly sliced garlic <br>
1/4 cup oyster sauce <br>

1/2 teaspoon (or more) 1/8'-thick slices of red Thai chiles <br>
Pinch of ground white pepper <br>
1/2 cup low-salt chicken broth <br>
<br>
Blanch brussels sprouts in a large pot of boiling salted water until bright green, about 15 seconds. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until light golden brown, about 30 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a small bowl.
Increase heat to high; add brussels sprouts. Stir-fry until they begin to soften, 2–3 minutes. Add oyster sauce and next 5 ingredients. Stir-fry for 30 seconds; add chicken broth. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is reduced slightly, about 2 minutes; add more chiles, if desired. Stir in garlic.

<h4>Thai Beef Stew with Lemongrass and Noodles </h4>
<p>
Yield: 6 servings <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
4 lemongrass stalks, trimmed, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced <br>
4 cloves garlic chopped <br>
4 kaffir lime leaves, chopped <br>
2 tablespoons chopped peeled ginger <br>
2 red Thai chiles, with seeds, sliced <br>
3 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2” pieces <br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
2 whole star anise pods <br>
1 cinnamon stick <br>
½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce <br>
1 tablespoon fish sauce (such as nam pla or nuoc nam) <br>
¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar <br>
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes <br>
4 medium shallots, quartered <br>
1 pound carrots, peeled, cut into 2” lengths, halved if large <br>
4 scallions, cut into 1” lengths, plus more for serving <br>
8 oz. wide rice noodles  <br>
Lime wedges (for serving) <br>
<br>
Process lemongrass, garlic, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, and 2 chiles in a food processor until a fine paste forms.
Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook beef, turning occasionally, until browned, 10–15 minutes; transfer to a plate.
Cook lemongrass paste in same pot, stirring often, until lemongrass is beginning to soften, 5–8 minutes. Add star anise, cinnamon, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, beef with any juices, and 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, partially covered, skimming occasionally, until beef is tender and liquid is slightly thickened, 2½–3 hours.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°. Toast coconut flakes on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden around the edges, about 4 minutes; set aside.
Add shallots and carrots to stew and cook, partially covered, until vegetables are soft and beef is falling apart, 35–45 minutes. Mix in scallions (they should wilt slightly).
Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions.
Divide noodles among bowls and ladle stew over; top with toasted coconut and more scallions. Serve with lime wedges.
DO AHEAD: Stew (without noodles) can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.

    <h4> Key Lime Pie with Chocolate-Almond Crust </h4>
Makes one 10-inch pie <br>
Ingredients: <br>
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing<br>
1 cup chocolate graham cracker crumbs (from 9 whole crackers)<br>
1/2 cup finely ground almonds<br>
1/3 cup sugar<br>
1 1/4 cups fresh lime juice, preferably key lime juice (from 25 key limes)<br>
1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest<br>
Two 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk<br>
2 large eggs at room temperature, lightly beaten<br>
1/2 cup cold heavy cream<br>
1/2 cup cold sour cream<br>
2 teaspoons sugar<br>
Key lime slices, for garnish (optional)<br>
<br>
Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375째 and butter a 10-inch glass pie plate. In a food processor, pulse the graham cracker crumbs with the ground almonds and sugar until thoroughly blended. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are moistened. Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and up the side of the pie plate to form the crust. Bake for about 20 minutes, just until the almonds are lightly browned. Let the crust cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, make the filling In a bowl, whisk together the lime juice, lime zest, condensed milk and eggs until smooth. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake for about 20 minutes, until set around the edge and slightly jiggly in the center. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until very firm, at least 6 hours or overnight.  Make the whipped cream In a bowl, using a handheld mixer, beat the heavy cream and sour cream until soft peaks form, 2 minutes. Beat in the sugar until stiff peaks form, 1 minute. Mound the whipped cream on the pie. Garnish with the key lime slices and serve.
<h4>Red Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Ice Cream </h4>
Serves : 12 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 cups skim milk<br>
1 cup heavy cream<br>
1 pound cream cheese, cut into cubes, at room temperature <br>
6 ounces white chocolate, coarsely chopped<br>
12 large egg yolks<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
1 tablespoon cocoa powder <br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil <br>
1 cup buttermilk<br>
2 large eggs<br>
2 tablespoons red food coloring (four 1/4-ounce bottles) <br>
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar<br>
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>
Confectioners' sugar, for serving<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
1/4 cup water<br>
1 cup pecan halves, toasted<br>
<br>
In a medium saucepan, warm the milk and cream. In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and white chocolate. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt until thick and pale. Gradually whisk the hot milk and cream into the yolks. Pour the mixture into the saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until it coats the back of a wooden spoon, 6 minutes; do not let it boil. Strain through a fine sieve over the cheese and chocolate. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir until smooth. Refrigerate until chilled, 4 hours. Pour the custard into an ice cream maker and churn. Transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 350째. Butter and flour a 12-inch round cake pan. In a large bowl, whisk the flour with the sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the oil with the buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vinegar and vanilla. Whisk the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 40 minutes. Transfer the cake to a rack and let it cool completely in the pan, 2 hours. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Cook over moderate heat without stirring until a deep amber caramel forms, about 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the pecans. Pour the praline onto the parchment-lined baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Let cool until hardened, then chop medium-fine and transfer to a bowl. Line the baking sheet with another sheet of parchment paper. Scoop 12 balls of the cream-cheese ice cream and set them on the baking sheet. Freeze the balls. Slice the cake into 12 wedges and dust with confectioners' sugar. Transfer to plates. Roll the ice cream balls in the pecan praline. Serve with the cake.
<h4>German Chocolate Cake</h4><br>
Serves : 8 to 10<br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans<br>
7 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped<br>
2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt<br>
1 3/4 cups sugar<br>
3 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
1 large egg yolk, at room temperature<br>
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>
1 cup buttermilk<br>
3 1/2 cups pecan halves (14 ounces)<br>
2 sticks plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature <br>
Two 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk<br>
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br>
5 large egg yolks<br>
10 ounces sweetened shredded coconut (3 cups) <br>
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>
1/4 teaspoon sea salt<br>
<br>
Preheat the oven to 350째. Butter two 9-inch baking pans and line them with parchment paper. Set a heatproof bowl over (but not in) a saucepan of simmering water. Add the chopped chocolate and melt, stirring occasionally. Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a microwave. Let cool slightly. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour with the cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. In a large bowl, beat the 1 1/2 sticks of butter with the sugar until light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. At low speed, beat in the buttermilk and the flour mixture in 3 alternating batches, ending with the flour mixture. Fold in the melted chocolate until incorporated. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for about 30 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean. Transfer the cakes to a rack and let cool completely. Turn the cakes out of the pans and peel off the parchment paper. Meanwhile, make the frosting. Toast the pecans on a rimmed baking sheet until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then coarsely chop. In a large saucepan, combine the butter, condensed milk and brown sugar and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until smooth. Add the egg yolks and cook over moderately low heat, whisking frequently, until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the frosting to a large bowl and stir in 3 cups of the pecans and the coconut, vanilla and salt; let cool. Using a spoon or offset spatula, spread half of the frosting evenly over one cake. Top with the second cake layer and spread the remaining frosting on top. Garnish with the remaining pecans.
<h4> Fortune Cookies </h4>

3 tablespoons butter, softened <br>
3 tablespoons sugar<br>
1 large egg white<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1/3 cup all-purpose flour<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 400째. Write fortunes on small strips of paper (3-1/2x1/4-in.); set aside. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

<h2> Spanish Foods </h2>
<p> <h4>Spanish Omelette </h4>
Serves: 4 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 kilogram (about 2 pounds) of potatoes<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
8 large eggs (free range if possible)<br>
1 onion<br>
Extra Virgin Olive Oil<br>
<br>
Peel the potatoes and rinse them under cold water.
Slice the potatoes into thin slices, I prefer about ½ centimeter (some prefer thicker)
Pat the potato slices dry and put them into a large bowl, sprinkle with salt, and mix well.
Heat a ½ inch of high quality extra virgin olive oil in a large frying pan at medium low heat.
When the oil is hot, add the potatoes and add more oil if necessary until all are covered.
Cook the potatoes for 20 minutes at a low heat (they may break apart, that is okay).
While the potatoes are cooking, beat the eggs in a large bowl and season with some salt and pepper.
Slice the onion as thin as possible (julianne style) and fry in a separate frying pan for about 10 minutes until they begin to caramelize (stir often).
When the onions are caramelized, drain off any excess oil and add to the egg mixture.
When the potatoes have been frying 20 minutes, remove them with a slotted spoon into a strainer and allow to cool off while any excess oil drips away.
After a few minutes, add the potatoes to the egg mixture and stir well.
Let the egg mixture sit for about 20 minutes.
In the same pan where you fried the potatoes, remove all the oil (you can reuse it!) and over a medium low heat add the egg mixture.
Over a low heat, cook the eggs for about 6-8 minutes per side.
When you are sure that the bottom is cooked and you want to flip the tortilla, take a large plate and put it over the pan and flip quickly! Some egg will likely slip out-- it'll be messy-- but that's okay!
Finally, slide out of the pan onto a serving plate and let cool a little before diving in. </p>
<p> <h4>Salmorejo </h4>
Serves: 4 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
8 Medium Tomatoes (the quality of the tomatoes is one of the most important factors in the taste)<br>
1 Medium Baguette<br>
1 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil (again, quality is important)<br>
1 Clove of Garlic (not too big)<br>
A Splash of Sherry Vinegar (Vinagre de Jerez, although red wine vinegar can be substituted)<br>
A Pinch of Salt<br>
2 Hard Boiled Eggs<br>
Sliced Serrano Ham (or Prosciutto)<br>
<br>
Scald the tomatoes: Put a large pot of salted water on the stove and bring to a boil. Cut a small cross in the bottom of each tomato. When the water is boiling add the tomatoes for 30-60 seconds. Remove immediately and place in a cold water bath (a bowl filled with ice and cold water). The skin will peel right off of the tomatoes.
First Blend: Cut out the cores of the tomatoes and add all the rest to your blender. Blend at high-speed for about 30 seconds until the tomatoes are broken down.
Add bread: Take all of the "guts" out of your baguette and add them to the blended tomatoes. The baguette should have given about 2-3 cups of guts and you can experiment with how much you add, as this is how you change the texture. I use about 2 cups of the bread guts. Let the bread soak in the tomato juice for about 5 minutes.
Second Blend: Add the splash of vinegar, salt, and garlic and blend until the soup is an even texture and the bread is completely broken down.
Add Oil: If your blender has it, open the small hole in the top. Slowly add the olive oil as you are blending at a moderate speed. If it doesn't have the hole, stop and go adding little by little.
Add Egg and Adjust: Add 1 hardboiled egg and blend until incorporated. Taste and adjust levels of salt, vinegar, garlic, and bread.
Serve and Enjoy: Serve in small bowls with diced hardboiled egg and sliced ham as condiments. Serve cold! Enjoy! </p>
<p> <h4>Spanish Pisto </h4>
Ingredients: <br>
3 small zucchini, diced <br>
2 medium red bell peppers, diced<br>
2 medium green bell peppers, diced<br>
4 medium onions, diced<br>
3 small purple eggplants, peeled and diced<br>
2 pounds of ripe tomatoes (the better your tomatoes, the better your pisto!), peeled and diced<br>
5 cloves of garlic, diced<br>
A pinch of thyme, rosemary and (optionally) fresh oregano<br>
1 teaspoon of cumin<br>
1 teaspoon of refined sugar (substitute honey or brown sugar for a more natural take)<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
A couple of dried cayenne peppers-- optional (and not traditional)!<br>
Extra virgin olive oil<br>
Optional: Fried eggs<br>
Optional: Manchego cheese (or any cured raw sheep's milk cheese)<br>
<br>
Peels and dice the vegetables as indicated, and layer the eggplant on paper towels then sprinkle with kosher salt. Let them sit at least 10 minutes.
Put two different frying pans on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil to each.
Add the diced onions to one of the pans, with a pinch of salt. Sauté over a medium-low heat until they start to turn transparent, then cover the pan and allow them to poach (you don't want them to brown). Once fully cooked, reserve in a large bowl.
In the meantime, add the peppers to the other pan and sauté over a medium high heat until starting to brown. Lower to medium and cover for about 10 minutes. Once cooked through reserve along with the onions.
Rinse the salt off of the eggplant in a mesh strainer.
Follow the same steps as the peppers to cook the zucchini and eggplant (in separate pans). You want to start cooking them on medium high, and once starting to brown lower the heat and cover until tender (stirring a few times so they don't stick). Then reserve along with the other vegetables, mixing to make all the flavors combine.
Add all of the spices to the bowl of vegetables and mix well.
Next, add a bit more oil to one of the pans if necessary, and add the diced garlic (and the dried cayenne peppers if using). Sauté over medium heat until starting to fry. Then add the peeled and diced tomato to the pan. Cook over a medium low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until you have tomato sauce. Add the sugar, and adjust for salt.
Now, in a large frying pan, mix the previously cooked veggies with the tomato sauce.
Mix everything well, and cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat. Adjust for salt and spices, and enjoy!
Optional Additions: The most famous pisto dishes in Spain are pisto con huevo (pisto with a fried egg on top) or pisto Manchego (pisto with sliced Manchego cheese on top). Both are great ways to enjoy your pisto as a meal, or you can serve as is as a side dish for fish or meat. </p>
<p> <h4> Espinacas con Garbonzos (Spinach and Chickpeas) </h4>
Serves: 4<br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 jar (around 500g or 18 ounces) of garbanzo beans (chickpeas) (note: you could also soak and cook dried garbanzos for even more delicious results, but I find that good quality canned beans do the trick nearly as well)<br>
1 large bag (around 300 grams/10 ounces) fresh spinach, washed <br>
2 thick slices of day old bread (sourdough works well) with crusts removed and cut into cubes <br>
15 blanched unsalted Marcona almonds<br>
¼ cup tomato sauce<br>
3 garlic cloves, chopped<br>
Extra virgin olive oil<br>
2 Tablespoons Sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar if sherry vinegar is hard to come by)<br>
1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
Ground cayenne pepper (to taste)<br>
Salt<br>
Black pepper (to taste)<br>
Smoked Spanish paprika (I use pimentón dulce, but you could also use pimentón picante)<br>
<br>
Coat a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil (approx. 2 T) and heat to medium high
Before the oil gets too hot, add the spinach (in batches if necessary)
Sauté the spinach until just wilted and remove to strain in a colander
Re-coat the pan with olive oil and add in the bread cubes and raw almonds. Fry until the bread and almonds are browned and crispy on each side
Add the chopped garlic, cumin, cayenne and black pepper and sauté for a couple of minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and turning brown
Transfer the ingredients to a blender/food processor and add the sherry vinegar
Blend the ingredients together until you have a thick paste (don't over blend and make it gooey)
Return the paste to the saucepan and add your garbanzo beans and tomato sauce
Stir gently until the chickpeas are fully coated by the sauce and add a bit of water to thin things out
Add the spinach and stir gently until it is evenly incorporated and hot
Season with salt and pepper
Once plated, drizzle a swirl of extra virgin olive oil on top of each dish, then sprinkle a small amount of smoked Spanish paprika on top
Enjoy! </p>
<p> <h4>Canarian Papas Arrugadas </h4>
Serves: 4-6 servings<br>
Ingredients:<br>
1¼ pounds (about 1 kg) of small, quick cooking potatoes<br>
¼ cup of coarse sea salt<br>
<br>
Wash the potatoes well and place them in a large stock pot.
Just cover with cold water and add the sea salt.
Boil the potatoes until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Add water if too much evaporates.
Pour off the water and rest the potatoes on the stove on a very low heat until all water has evaporated and the potatoes are covered in a layer of sea salt.
Serve with your favorite mojo sauce. </p>

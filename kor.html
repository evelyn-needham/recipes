<h2> Korean Food </h2>
  <h4> Bibimbap </h4>
  <p>
3 servings<br>
Ingredients: <br>
1 cup uncooked white rice <br>
10 ounces mushrooms sliced<br>
5 ounces carrots sliced<br>
1 zucchini sliced<br>
3 eggs<br>
3 tablespoons gochujang<br>
3/4 teaspoon black sesame seeds<br>
3/4 pound flank steak thinly sliced <br>
2 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
1 tablespoon corn starch<br>
<br>
Make the marinade: Rub corn starch onto sliced flank steak in a bowl. Drizzle soy sauce over the steak. Let sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Cook the rice: Cook rice according to package instructions. Distribute the rice among 3 serving bowls.
Cook the toppings: Heat a pan over medium heat until hot, a few minutes. Cook each of the vegetable toppings in turn, until they just start to become tender, about 8 minutes for the carrots, 5 minutes for the mushrooms, and 5 minutes for the zucchini. Sear the steak until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Fry the eggs on one side until the whites are firm but the yolks are still liquid.
Assemble the bowls: Distribute the toppings among the serving bowls with rice. Drizzle gochujang over the serving bowls. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds. Serve immediately.

<h4> Dak Gomtang </h4>
<p> Ingredients: <br>
1 whole chicken 3 - 4 pounds <br>
10 - 12 garlic cloves<br>
1 small piece ginger<br>
1/2 medium onion<br>
2 - 3 scallion white parts<br>
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppers<br>
3 scallions, finely chopped to garnish<br>
salt and pepper to taste<br>
<br>
Place the cleaned chicken in a stock pot large enough to hold the chicken and 10 cups of water (6 - 8 quarts). Add the garlic, ginger, onion, scallions, optional peppers and 10 cups of water (or enough to cover the chicken).
Bring it to a boil over high heat. Skim off any foam on top. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, covered, for about 40 - 50 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken. Cut through the thickest part of the breast, with a knife, to see if the chicken is cooked and tender.
Turn the heat off and carefully remove the chicken. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat off the bones. Shred the meat into small bite size pieces. You can strain the broth, remove the excess fat and serve at this point. But, I put the bones back in the soup and simmer again for more flavorful broth.
Optional Step: Put the bones back in the broth and simmer over medium low heat for an additional 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much time you have.
Strain the broth and remove the excess fat. You can spoon off the fat, refrigerate the broth until the fat solidifies, or use a fat separator.
To serve, place some rice in a serving bowl, add chicken pieces, and then ladle the hot broth on top. Typically, chopped scallions, salt and pepper are served separately so each person can season to taste. Serve piping hot with kimchi.

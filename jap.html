<h2> Japanese Food </h2>
  <h4> Fried Rice </h4>
  <p>
Servings: 1 (as main dish) <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
2 rice bowls cooked Japanese short grain rice (Ideally a day old, See blog post) <br>
2 slices ham<br>
1 green onion/scallion<br>
1 large egg <br>
2 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (divided)<br>
½ tsp salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt) (¼ tsp if using table salt)<br>
white pepper (a must have for my fried rice!)<br>
2 tsp soy sauce (I use Kikkoman® Gluten Free Tamari Soy Sauce)<br>
<br>
Gather all the ingredients.
To prepare steamed rice, microwave your one-day-old rice that’s kept in the refrigerator until room temperature or warm. If you do not have one-day-old rice, then you can cook the rice, spread it out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and leave it out on the counter without cover for 1-2 hours. This will remove moisture in the rice.
Cut the white part of the green onion into rounds and the green part diagonally, dividing the white and green parts.
Cut the ham into ¼ inch square pieces.
Crack and whisk the egg in a bowl.
Make sure all the ingredients are ready to go. Heat the wok (or the large frying pan) on medium high heat. Once it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp oil and swirl around to make sure all sides of the work (frying pan) are coated with oil. Add the beaten egg and mix around so that fluffy egg will be created.
While some parts of the egg are still a little bit runny (not all the way cooked), transfer to a plate. We do not want to overcook the egg at this stage.
Add 1 Tbsp oil and start cooking ham and white parts of the chopped green onion. Stir fry and coat well with oil.
Add the room temp/warm rice into the wok (frying pan). Separate the rice with a spatula, without damaging the rice. Don’t make it mushy by pressing down, but fluff out the rice so it is coated with oil and gets nice wok char.
Add the cooked egg back in the wok and break into smaller pieces while you combine with the rice. If some of the rice sticks to the wok, don’t worry (it happens when the oil was not enough) as you can scrape it off easily and creates nice char taste).
Season with salt and white pepper. You can add more later after adding soy sauce, if not enough.
Add the soy sauce. The key action here is to toss the fried rice in the wok and make it fluffy instead of a big mess of fried rice sitting at the bottom of the wok.
Add green parts of the chopped green onion. And after tossing a few more times, transfer to a plate.
Fried rice at Chinese restaurants in Japan is often served in a dome shape. If you like to serve it this way, fill the fried rice in a rice bowl, pat down lightly to compact and invert onto a plate.
Sprinkle green onion on top, and serve!

<h4>Stir fry Vegetables</h4>
<p>
Servings: 4 <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
6.5 oz thinly sliced pork (6.5 oz = 185 g) (skip for vegetarian/vegan)<br>
10 snow peas (10 snow peas = about 1 oz / 30 g)<br>
¼ onion (¼ onion = about 3 oz / 90 g)<br>
¼ cabbage (¼ cabbage = about 7 oz / 200 g)<br>
½ carrot (½ carrot = about 3 oz / 90 g)<br>
1 clove garlic<br>
1 inch ginger (1" = 2.5 cm)<br>
1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)<br>
2 cups bean sprouts (2 cups = about 3.9 oz / 110 g) (loosely packed)<br>
1 tsp soy sauce<br>
1 tsp sake<br>
1 tsp oyster sauce (skip for vegetarian/vegan)<br>
1 tsp soy sauce<br>
½ tsp salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt)<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 tsp sesame oil<br>
<br>
Gather all the ingredients.
Cut the meat into smaller pieces if necessary, and marinade the meat with 1 tsp. soy sauce and 1 tsp. sake in a small bowl.
Remove the strings from snow peas and cut the onion into thin slices.
Cut the cabbage into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces.
Cut the carrot into 2” (5 cm) long slabs then cut into matchsticks.
Crush (or mince) the garlic and mince the ginger.
In a large frying pan or wok, heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil on medium high heat. Once it’s hot, add the garlic and ginger. When fragrant, add the meat and cook until it’s about 80% done. Alternatively you can cook till no longer pink and take the meat out, then add your meat back in when all the veggies are cooked. This will prevent the meat from getting over-cooked.
Add the onion and stir fry until almost tender. Then add the carrot. If you are going to add other kinds of vegetables that are not in the recipe, start cooking the thicker and tougher vegetables first as they take a longer time to cook.
Once the carrot is getting tender, add the cabbage and snow peas. Continue to stir and toss the ingredients.
Then add the bean sprouts and toss one more time. Add 1 tsp. oyster sauce and 1 tsp. soy sauce.
Add the salt, freshly ground black pepper, and drizzle 2 tsp. sesame oil. Enjoy immediately, this dish is fantastic with rice and miso soup.

<h4>Omurice<h4>
  <p>
Servings: 2 <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
¼ onion (¼ = 60 g)<br>
4 mushrooms (4 mushrooms = 50 g)<br>
4 slices ham (4 slices = 2 thick slices = 80 g)<br>
1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)<br>
3 Tbsp green peas (3 Tbsp = 25 g) (defrosted and drained, if frozen)<br>
salt (kosher or sea salt; use half if using table salt)<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
2 - 2 ½ cups cooked Japanese short grain rice (2 cups = 360 g)<br>
2 Tbsp unsalted butter (divided)<br>
Tomato Sauce<br>
3 Tbsp ketchup<br>
3 Tbsp tomato paste<br>
2 Tbsp water<br>
Egg Mixture<br>
4 large eggs (divided)<br>
2 Tbsp milk (divided)<br>
INSTRUCTIONS: <br>
Gather all the ingredients.<br>
To make tomato sauce, combine ketchup, tomato paste, and water in a small saucepan and mix all together. Set aside.
Clean the mushrooms with damp towel and slice them.
Slice the onion and dice into small pieces.
Cut the ham into small pieces.
In a 10-inch frying pan, heat 1 Tbsp vegetable oil and sauté onion.
Add green peas and mushrooms, and hams.
Season with pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Add rice and break big chunks of rice into smaller pieces.
When combined well, add 3-4 Tbsp tomato sauce and mix well. Make sure to save some sauce for topping. Divide the fried rice in half.
Make the omelette & put it together (Makes 2 Omurice):
Start with the first omurice. Crack 2 eggs in a small bowl and add 1 Tbsp milk and pinch of salt. Whisk all together.
Heat another frying pan over medium high heat and add 1 Tbsp butter. Swirl around and when it’s melted, add the beaten egg.
Quickly swirl around with chopsticks. When the mixture is set but still runny, add half of ketchup rice in the middle. If you feel the pan is getting too hot, remove the pan from the heat and put on top of the damp towel.
Wrap the ketchup rice both sides with egg omelette.  It doesn’t have to be perfectly wrapped, but make sure to create the “edge” around the fried rice with omelette.
Place the serving plate under the pan and flip the pan to transfer the omelette rice.
place a piece of paper towel and gently shape the omelettte into a football shape.  Repeat this process to make the second omurice.
When serving, garnish omurice with parsley and drizzle hot tomato sauce.

<h4> Soba Noodle Salad </h4>
<p>
Servings: 4<br>
INGREDIENTS:<br>
7 oz dried soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) (7 oz = 200 g = 2-3 bundles)<br>
2 green onions/scallions<br>
1 bunch cilantro (.7 oz = 20 g)<br>
1 Tbsp white sesame seeds (roasted/toasted)<br>
1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc)<br>
3 Tbsp sesame oil<br>
1/2 tsp crushed red peppers (red pepper flakes)<br>
3 Tbsp honey<br>
3 Tbsp soy sauce<br>
<br>
Gather all the ingredients.
To make the dressing, combine 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp. sesame oil, and ½ tsp. crushed red peppers in a small saucepan.
Whisk all together and infuse the oil over medium heat for 3 minutes. Alternatively, you can put these ingredients in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Set aside to let it cool a bit; be careful while handling as it'll get very hot.
Add 3 Tbsp. honey and 3 Tbsp. soy sauce to the oil mixture.
Whisk all together until honey is completely dissolved.
Bring water to a boil (You do not need to salt the water for cooking soba.). Cook the soba noodles according to the package instructions, but make sure they are al dente. Drain into a colander and rinse the soba noodles under cold running water. This step is important to remove the starch from the soba noodles. Drain well and transfer to a large bowl.
Thinly slice the green onions and chop cilantro into small pieces.
Combine the soba noodles, dressing, green onion, cilantro, and sesame seeds in the bowl.
Toss everything together. Transfer to a serving bowl or plate. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

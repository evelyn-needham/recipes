  <p> <h4>Corned Beef Hash with Fried Eggs</h4>
Yield: 6<br>
Ingredients: <br>
1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
3 baking potatoes (about 2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice <br>
1 medium onion, thinly sliced<br>
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper<br>
1 1/2 pounds cooked corned beef, fat trimmed and meat cut into 1/2-inch dice<br>
4 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 cup canned tomato sauce<br>
1 tablespoon hot sauce, plus more for serving<br>
6 large eggs<br>
Snipped chives, for serving<br>
<br>
In a very large nonstick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil. Add the potatoes and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes.
Add the onion and bell pepper and season with salt and pepper. Cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the corned beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce and 1 tablespoon of hot sauce and simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is very thick, about 15 minutes.
 In another large nonstick skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Crack the eggs into the skillet and fry sunny-side up or over-easy. Spoon the hash onto plates and top with the eggs. Sprinkle with chives and serve right away </p>
<p> <h4>Smoked Gouda and Bacon Burgers with BBQ Sauce</h4>
Yield: 4 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil <br>
One 1-pound onion, halved and thinly sliced <br>
Salt<br>
1/4 cup Frank’s RedHot or other hot sauce<br>
1/4 cup beef broth<br>
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened<br>
Eight 1/2-inch-thick slices of firm white bread<br>
8 slices of thick-cut bacon<br>
2 pounds ground beef chuck (20 percent fat), formed into 4 patties the same size as the bread slices<br>
3 ounces smoked Gouda, shredded (1 cup)<br>
1/4 cup Sweet Barbecue Sauce<br>
<br>
In a large skillet, heat the oil. Add the sliced onion and a pinch of salt, cover and cook, stirring a few times, until the onion is crisp-tender and just turning translucent, 5 minutes. Stir in the hot sauce and beef broth and remove from the heat. Season with salt.
Heat a large griddle. Spread the butter on 1 side of each bread slice and griddle buttered side down over moderate heat until toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer the toasts to a plate. Add the bacon to the griddle and cook over moderate heat until crisp, about 4 minutes per side; drain on paper towels. Wipe off the griddle.
Season the beef patties with salt and cook on the griddle over moderately high heat until medium-rare, about 2 minutes per side. Top each burger with 1/4 cup of smoked Gouda and cook until the cheese melts, 1 minute.
Set the burgers on the unbuttered sides of 4 toasts. Top with the bacon, onion and Sweet Barbecue Sauce. Close the burgers and serve, passing more barbecue sauce at the table. </p>
<p> <h4>Inside-Out Grilled Ham-and-Cheese Sandwiches</h4>

8 ounces thinly sliced ham<br>
Dill pickle slices (optional)<br>
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br>
1/4 cup apricot preserves<br>
<br>
Butter each slice of bread and sprinkle with Parmigiano, pressing to help it adhere. Invert the slices onto a work surface, cheese side down. Top 4 of the slices with the Swiss cheese, ham and pickles. Mix the mustard and preserves and spread on the remaining 4 slices of bread. Close the sandwiches and griddle over moderate heat, turning, until golden, crisp on the outside and melted inside, about 3 minutes. Cut in half and serve right away. </p>

<p> <h4> Honey-Tamarind Baby Back Ribs</h4 >
Yield: 4 <br>
Ingredients: <br>
2 racks baby back ribs (5 1/4 pounds) <br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>
1/2 cup clover or other mild honey <br>
1/4 cup ketchup <br>
2 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons tamarind concentrate<br>
2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped<br>
1/2 teaspoon Asian chile paste, such as sambal oelek<br>

Preheat the oven to 275°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Put the ribs on the baking sheet and season on both sides with salt and black pepper. Bake the ribs, meaty side up, for 2 1/2 hours, or until tender.
Meanwhile, in a food processor, blend the honey, ketchup, soy sauce, ginger, tamarind, garlic and chile paste until smooth.
Increase the oven temperature to 450°. Drain the fat from the baking sheet. Brush the ribs with the barbecue sauce. Roast the ribs, bony side up, for 10 minutes, until richly browned. Turn the ribs over, brush with more sauce and roast for 5 minutes, until browned. Brush the ribs with the remaining barbecue sauce and roast for 5 minutes longer, until deeply browned and glossy. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes. Cut the racks into ribs and serve.

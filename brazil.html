<h2>Brazilian Foods </h2>
<p> <h4>Brazilian Chicken Bread </h4>
yield:  30 CHEESE ROLLS <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
4 cups tapioca flour <br>
1 1/4 cups milk<br>
1/2 cup water <br>
6 tablespoons oil <br>
1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese <br>
1 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese<br>
2 large eggs <br>
2 teaspoons salt<br>
 <br>
Preheat oven to 400F degrees with a rack in the middle.
Combine the milk, water, oil and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat.
Add the tapioca flour to the bowl of a stand mixer and, once the milk mixture boils, pour it over the flour. Turn the mixer on and mix it well. The texture will be fondant-like, really white and sticky.
With the mixer still on, add the eggs, one at a time. You will think they won't mix, since the tapioca flour mixture is so sticky, but hang in there cause they will.
Once the eggs are incorporated, add the cheese, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.
The dough is supposed to be soft and sticky. However, if you're worried it's too liquidy, add some more tapioca flour. Just don't over do it or your cheese bread will be tough and not too gooey.
To shape the balls, wet your hands with cold water and, using a spoon, scoop some of the dough to shape balls that are a little smaller than golf-sized.
Place the balls on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and bring it to the preheat oven.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden and puffed.
Serve them warm! :)

<p> <h4> Brazilian Vinaigrette Salsa</h4>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
1 large onion, diced <br>
4 tomatoes, diced<br>
1 green or red bell pepper, diced (optional)<br>
1/3 cup chopped parsley<br>
1/4 cup white wine vinegar<br>
1/2 cup olive oil<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
<br>
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.
Season with salt and pepper and serve.
NOTES <br>
1) The vinaigrette tastes even better if you let it rest at room temperature (or in the fridge) for about 30 minutes to one hour!
2) Brazilians usually make vinaigrette salsa with yellow onions, but you can substitute to your favorite kind of onion here. </p>
<p> <h4>Feijao Tropeiro </h4>
yield:  6 AS MAIN COURSE AND 8 AS A SIDE DISH <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
1 pound dry carioca beans (substitute: pinto beans), rinsed * <br>
2 bay leaves, dried or fresh<br>
6 cups water<br>
1 bunch collard greens, rinsed and dried<br>
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided<br>
14 ounces calabresa sausage, sliced (substitute: chorizo, smoked kielbasa or any other smoked sausage)<br>
1/2 pound thick sliced bacon, diced<br>
1 large onion, sliced<br>
6 cloves of garlic, minced, divided<br>
5 eggs <br>
1 to 1 1/2 cups toasted manioc flour <br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Chopped parsley and green onions to taste<br>
<br>
Start by cooking your beans. My preferred method is using a pressure cooker: combine the beans, bay leaves and water in your pot. Secure the lid and bring it to the stove, over high heat. When it reaches high pressure, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pot to cool down and release all the pressure naturally. When ready to open, unlock and remove the lid. Check if the beans are al dente. If not, cook them longer, in 5 minute increments. (Note: this method is for stove top pressure cookers. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, follow your cooker's instructions to cook beans.)
You can also cook your beans the conventional way, on the stove, but it will take longer. Just bring the beans, bay leaves and water to a boil, over medium-high heat. When boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered, until al dente, adding more water as needed to keep the beans submerged. The cooking process can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. Be patient! (Or get a pressure cooker.)
When the beans are done, drain all the water and reserve.
Remove the stems of the collard greens leaves. Then, stack a few leaves on top of each other and roll that stack into a cylinder. Using a chef knife, slice the collard greens into thin strips. Repeat with all the leaves.
Place the oil in a medium-sized skillet and place it over medium heat. Whisk the eggs in a bowl and add them to the pan. Cook, stirring gently, until they are scrambled. Reserve.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add 3 cloves of garlic and cook, stirring often, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the collard greens and cook until withered, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and reserve.
Using that same pan, over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and brown the sausage until it starts to get crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and reserve. Discard the fat.
In the same pan, add the bacon and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Then, stir in the onions and remaining garlic, cooking until translucent (about 3 more minutes). Add the drained beans and the sausage and cook for a minute, letting the beans soak up all those amazing flavors. Then, add the eggs and the collard greens, stirring until everything is well combined. Season generoulsy with salt and pepper. Then, add the manioc flour (to taste), a handful at a time, stirring until it is moist and incorporated into the dish.
Remove the pan from the heat and sprinkle the parsley and green onions.
Serve immediately!
<p> <h4> Brazilian Style Chicken Wings </h4>

 INGREDIENTS: <br>
2lbs small chicken wings<br>
Juice of 3 limes<br>
5 garlic cloves, minced<br>
5 garlic cloves, sliced<br>
1/4 cup olive oil<br>
1/2 cup flour<br>
Red pepper flakes (optional)<br>
Salt and pepper <br>
Chopped parsley to garnish <br>
Lime wedges to garnish <br>
Vegetable oil to fry <br>
<br>
In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, the minced garlic and the salt and pepper. Add the chicken wings and toss them with the marinade, making sure every piece of chicken is coated. Cover and bring the bowl to the fridge overnight.
The next day, add the flour and the wings to a ziplock bag. Close the bag and shake it so every wing is coated in flour.
Fill a saucepan with enough oil to deep fry the wings. Heat the oil over medium high heat and, when the oil is hot enough, lower the heat to medium low and start frying the wings in batches, 5 or 6 at a time.
When the wings look cooked and beginning to gain some color, turn the heat up to high, so they get extra crispy, and fry them until golden brown.
Set the fried wings over paper towel to absorb the excess oil.
Turn the heat back to low and proceed to frying the other wings.
Once all the wings are fried, transfer them to a serving dish and decorate with some lime slices and wedges.
In a saute pan, heat the olive oil and sauté the sliced garlic. Pour that garlic over the wings.
Finish the dish with some chopped parsley and red pepper flakes (if using) and serve! (You can serve them with some Tabasco sauce on the side for the spicy aficionados!) </p>

	<p> <h4>Brazilian Chicken Pot Pie </h4>
yield:  10 <br>
INGREDIENTS: <br>
2 tablespoons olive oil <br>
2 medium onions, finely chopped<br>
2 garlic cloves, minced<br>
2 tomatoes, chopped<br>
2 pounds chicken breast, cooked and shredded<br>
1/2 cup chopped green olives<br>
1 cup corn (optional)<br>
1 cup green peas (optional)<br>
1 cup hearts of palm, chopped (optional)<br>
1 cup tomato sauce<br>
A couple dashes of hot sauce<br>
2 cups chicken broth <br>
1 tablespoon flour dissolved in 1/3 cup milk<br>
1/2 cup chopped parsley<br>
Salt and pepper to taste <br>
5 cups flour <br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
3 egg yolks<br>
1/4 cup to 1/2 cup cold water<br>
3 sticks butter (12 ounces), cut into smaller pieces<br>
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten, for brushing<br>
<br>
In a large sauté pan, over medium heat, add the olive oil and, once hot, sauté the onions and garlic until translucent, about 2 minutes.
Add the tomatoes and cook them with the onions and garlic for a couple of minutes, until softened.
Add the shredded chicken,olives, corn (if using), peas (if using), hearts of palm (if using), tomato sauce, hot sauce and stir to combine. Then, add the chicken broth and the flour dissolved in milk. Lower the heat to medium low and cook, stirring often, until most of the liquid is gone and the filling is creamy and lightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Add the chopped parsley and stir to incorporate.
Taste for seasoning and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Cool completely before assembling the pie.
Combine the flour and the salt in a large bowl.
Add the egg yolks and stir using a wooden spoon.
Then add the butter and use your fingers to work the butter into the flour, until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Add the water, a few tablespoons of a time, and continue working with your fingers until the dough comes together. You might not need all the water!
Wrap the dough and chill for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F degrees.
When the dough is chill, cut 1/3 of the dough and reserve. Roll out the remaining dough to about 12" round. Place the pastry in a 9-inch spring form pan, making sure the dough also covers the sides (since we have lots of filling!), and prick it all over with a fork.
Add the cold filling, smoothing it out so its evenly distributed.
Then, roll out the remaining dough and place it on top of the filling, sealing the pie and tucking the edges.
Using a knife, make two cuts in the center of the top crust, so that steam can escape while baking.
Brush the pie with the lightly beaten egg yolk.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown and the filling piping hot.
Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before serving.</p>
